Weylus uses the uinput interface to simulate input events on Linux. To enable stylus and multi-touch support /dev/uinput needs to be writable by Weylus. To make /dev/uinput permanently writable by your user, run the following inside a terminal:

sudo groupadd -r uinput
sudo usermod -aG uinput $USER
echo 'KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="uinput", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/60-weylus.rules

Then, either reboot, or run

sudo udevadm control --reload
sudo udevadm trigger

then log out and log in again. To undo this, run:

sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/60-weylus.rules

This allows your user to synthesize input events system-wide, even when another user is logged in. Therefore, untrusted users should not be added to the uinput group.

If you do not want to make use of this feature uncheck "Enable uinput" in your browser. Like this Weylus will only simulate a mouse.
